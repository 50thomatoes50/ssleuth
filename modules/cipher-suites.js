/* The cipher suites preferences are boolean flags, and can be toggled

 * and to user's own preferences.
 *		1. default - nothing is done in this case.
 * 		2. reset   - clear any existing preferences to their default values
 * 		3. enable  - enable the cipher suites in the list
 * 		4. disable - disable the cipher suites in the list
 *
 * By default nothing will be done, unless the user initiates
 *		an enable, disable or reset through UI/config window.
 * "reset" is only a transition state, which means once the reset
 *		is done, the state is set to "default".
 * "enable" and "disable" are permanent states, ie. everytime the preferences
 * are loaded, on every startup these states are checked and cipher suites
 * are enabled/disabled.
